# Serverless AWS Lambda Events

Welcome to the AWS Serverless Events Glossary.

Please select a section on the left to get started, or read on for general
information regarding Lambda Events in Serverless.

## Usage

Serverless enables creation, and management, of Lambda event triggers
via the `events` configuration key. This key takes a list of objects
which describe the events you wish your function to be subscribed to.

For example, to create a function which listens to an SNS topic called
`dispatch`, and also runs every two hours:
```
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: dispatcher.dispatch
    events:
      - sns: dispatch
      - schedule: rate(2 hours)
```

The events managed within the `events` list may be referenced using
CloudFormation intrinsic functions like `Fn::GetAtt` or `Fn::Ref` (or their
shorthand counterparts). The name of the created CloudFormation resource is
generated by prefixing the chosen name of the event with the resource type.

The CloudFormation resource type of an SNS topic is: `SNS::Topic`. Therefore,
to reference the SNS topic labeled `dispatch`, above, one would specify:

```
Some:
  Key:
    Ref: SNSTopicDispatch
```

Note: generated CloudFormation Resource identifiers are transformed to
upper-camelcase, regardless of the case of the input identifier, hence the ID
`SNSTopicDispatch` rather than `SNSTopicdispatch` above.
